# Express.js Overview

## What is Express.js?

Express.js is a fast, minimal, and flexible web framework for Node.js that helps developers build server-side web applications and APIs easily. Express simplifies the process of handling different HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), routing, middleware, and error handling—making backend development faster and more efficient.

***

## Why is Express.js Important in the Industry?

- **Widely Used:** Express.js is the most popular Node.js framework and is used by companies of all sizes for rapid server and API development.
- **Scalable & Fast:** Its minimal design keeps apps lightweight and performance high.
- **Flexibility:** You can structure projects and select features according to your requirements, using thousands of available middleware and npm packages.
- **Active Community:** Massive support, resources, and regular updates.
- **Interview Favorite:** Express.js skills are often asked in technical interviews for backend and full-stack developer roles.

## Key Features

- **Routing:** Handles URL paths and HTTP methods to organize app logic.
- **Middleware Support:** Easily add functionality for logging, authentication, error handling, and more.
- **Static File Serving:** Serve HTML, CSS, and images right from server.
- **Easy Integration:** Works with databases, templating engines, and third-party tools.

## Typical Express.js Setup (Code Example)

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Example middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

// Route handling
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

// Start server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Express server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
- The code above sets up a basic Express server, uses middleware, and handles HTTP GET requests.
