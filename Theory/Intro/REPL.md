# Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

## What is REPL?

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It is an interactive tool that comes with Node.js. REPL lets you write and run JavaScript code directly from the terminal, without needing to create a file.

### How REPL works:

- **Read:** It reads the JavaScript code you type.
- **Eval:** It runs (evaluates) the code.
- **Print:** It shows the result.
- **Loop:** It waits for you to type more code and repeats the process.

This loop continues until you exit the REPL.

## Why use REPL?

- It helps you quickly test small bits of code.
- Great for learning and debugging.
- No need to save your code in a file before running it.
- Fast and easy way to experiment in Node.js.

## How to start REPL?

Simply open your terminal or command prompt and type:

```
node
```

You will see a prompt like this:

```
>
```

Now you can type JavaScript code and press Enter to see the result immediately!

## Example in REPL:

```
> 2 + 2
4
> const greet = (name) => 'Hello ' + name;
undefined
> greet('Node.js')
'Hello Node.js'
```

## How to exit REPL?

- Type `.exit` and press Enter, or
- Press `Ctrl+C` twice.

REPL is a powerful and easy way to interact with Node.js and try out JavaScript code quickly and efficiently.
