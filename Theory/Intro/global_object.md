Here is a simple, well-organized GitHub README section about the Global Object in Node.js with explanations and examples:

# Node.js Global Object

In Node.js, the **global object** is named `global`. It is similar to the `window` object in browsers and acts as a container for variables and functions that are available everywhere in your Node.js application.[1][5]

## What is the Global Object?

- The global object exists in the **global scope**, meaning variables and functions attached to it can be accessed from any file or module.
- It provides access to built-in features like timers (`setTimeout`), console logging (`console.log`), process information (`process`), and buffers (`Buffer`).
- Unlike browsers where global variables declared with `var` automatically attach to the global object, in Node.js you must explicitly add variables to `global`.

## Why Use the Global Object?

- To share constants or configuration across your entire application.
- To access built-in Node.js features without importing.

## Example

```js
global.appName = "MyNodeApp";

console.log(global.appName); // Output: MyNodeApp
```

This global variable can be used in any module or file in your app.

## Common Built-in Global Objects

| Object         | Description                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| `global`       | The global container object          |
| `console`      | For logging output to the terminal   |
| `process`      | Provides info and control of Node.js runtime |
| `Buffer`       | Used for working with binary data    |
| `setTimeout` / `setInterval` | Timer functions to run code later or repeatedly |

## Best Practices

- Avoid polluting the global space with too many variables to prevent conflicts.
- Use the global object sparingly, mainly for truly global constants or utilities.
- Prefer module exports and imports for better modularity and maintainability.

This summary helps you understand and use the Node.js global object effectively in your projects.
