# Node.js Modules: Core, Local & Third-Party

## What are Modules in Node.js?

Modules are reusable pieces of code in Node.js that help organize your program into manageable parts. They allow you to split your code into different files and use functions, objects, or values across them.

***

## Types of Node.js Modules

### 1. Core Modules

- Core modules come bundled with Node.js â€” no installation needed!
- Examples:  
  - `fs` (File system operations)  
  - `http` (Create HTTP servers)  
  - `path` (Work with file paths)  
  - `os` (Get system info)  
- You use them by requiring their name directly:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

***

### 2. Local Modules

- Modules you create locally in your project as separate files.
- You export functions or data from one file and import them in another.
- Example: Suppose you have a file `math.js`:

```js
// math.js
exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
exports.sub = (a, b) => a - b;
```

Use it in `app.js` like this:

```js
const math = require('./math');
console.log(math.add(5, 3));  // Output: 8
console.log(math.sub(5, 3));  // Output: 2
```

***

### 3. Third-Party Modules

- These are modules created by the community and published on npm (Node Package Manager).
- You need to install them before use via npm, for example:

```
npm install express
```

- Then require and use in your project:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## Summary Table

| Module Type    | Description                               | How to Use                    | Example Module    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Core           | Built-in Node.js modules                   | `require('module_name')`      | fs, http, path    |
| Local          | User-created modules in project files     | `require('./filename')`       | `./math.js`       |
| Third-Party    | Modules installed from npm registry        | `npm install`, then `require` | express, lodash   |

Modules make Node.js applications modular, maintainable, and easy to extend!

Happy coding!

# Difference Between Core, Local, and Third-Party Modules in Node.js

| Criteria             | Core Modules                       | Local Modules                           | Third-Party Modules                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Definition           | Built-in modules included with Node.js by default | Modules created by you in your project | Modules developed by others, installed via npm  |
| Installation         | No installation needed           | No installation needed                 | Need to install with `npm install`      |
| Location             | Part of Node.js runtime          | Stored as files within your project   | Stored in `node_modules` directory       |
| Usage                | Require by module name, e.g., `require('fs')` | Require by relative path, e.g., `require('./math')` | Require by module name after install, e.g., `require('express')` |
| Examples             | `fs`, `path`, `http`, `os`       | Custom files like `math.js`, `utils.js` | `express`, `lodash`, `mongoose`          |
| Purpose              | Provide essential, low-level functionality | Organize and reuse your own code        | Extend app with extra features/libraries |
| Control              | Controlled by Node.js             | Fully controlled by you                | Controlled by external developers        |
